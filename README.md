# DSA Projects Repository

Welcome to the **DSA Projects** repository! This repository **will** contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) projects implemented in C++, aimed at enhancing problem-solving skills and understanding the core concepts of computer science.

## Contents

This repository **will** includes the following types of projects:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of various sorting techniques such as Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, and more.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Projects involving searching techniques like Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations and operations on data structures like:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees (Binary Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
  - Heaps
  - Graphs
  - Hash Tables
- **Dynamic Programming**: Problem-solving using dynamic programming techniques.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Implementation of various greedy algorithms.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Algorithms like DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.
- **Backtracking**: Problem-solving using backtracking techniques.
- **Recursion**: Examples of recursion-based problem-solving.
